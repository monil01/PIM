  abstract         = {Processing-using-memory (PuM) techniques leverage the analog operation of memory cells to perform computation. Several recent works have demonstrated PuM techniques in off-the-shelf DRAM devices. Since DRAM is the dominant memory technology as main memory in current computing systems, these PuM techniques represent an opportunity for alleviating the data movement bottleneck at very low cost. However, system integration of PuM techniques imposes non-trivial challenges that are yet to be solved. Design space exploration of potential solutions to the PuM integration challenges requires appropriate tools to develop necessary hardware and software components. Unfortunately, current specialized DRAM-testing platforms, or system simulators do not provide the flexibility and/or the holistic system view that is necessary to deal with PuM integration challenges.
We design and develop PiDRAM, the first flexible end-to-end framework that
enables system integration studies and evaluation of real PuM techniques.
PiDRAM provides software and hardware components to rapidly integrate PuM
techniques across the whole system software and hardware stack (e.g., necessary
modifications in the operating system, memory controller). We implement PiDRAM
on an FPGA-based platform along with an open-source RISC-V system. Using
PiDRAM, we implement and evaluate two state-of-the-art PuM techniques: in-DRAM
(i) copy and initialization, (ii) true random number generation. Our results
show that the in-memory copy and initialization techniques can improve the
performance of bulk copy operations by 12.6x and bulk initialization operations
by 14.6x on a real system. Implementing the true random number generator
requires only 190 lines of Verilog and 74 lines of C code using PiDRAM's
software and hardware components.},

  abstract         = {Serialization frameworks are a fundamental component of scale-out systems, but introduce
significant compute overheads. However, they are amenable to acceleration with specialized
hardware. To understand the trade-offs involved in architecting such an accelerator,
we present the first in-depth study of serialization framework usage at scale by profiling
Protocol Buffers (“protobuf”) usage across Google’s datacenter fleet. We use this
data to build HyperProtoBench, an open-source benchmark representative of key serialization-framework
user services at scale. In doing so, we identify key insights that challenge prevailing
assumptions about serialization framework usage. We use these insights to develop
a novel hardware accelerator for protobufs, implemented in RTL and integrated into
a RISC-V SoC. Applications can easily harness the accelerator, as it integrates with
a modified version of the open-source protobuf library and is wire-compatible with
standard protobufs. We have fully open-sourced our RTL, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the only such implementation currently available to the community. We
also present a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end evaluation of our entire RTL-based system
running hyperscale-derived benchmarks and microbenchmarks. We boot Linux on the system
using FireSim to run these benchmarks and implement the design in a commercial 22nm
FinFET process to obtain area and frequency metrics. We demonstrate an average 6.2
\texttimes{} to 11.2 \texttimes{} performance improvement vs. our baseline RISC-V SoC with BOOM OoO cores
and despite the RISC-V SoC’s weaker uncore/supporting components, an average 3.8 \texttimes{}

Unlike the existing near-data processing approach such as HMC 2.0, which utilizes additional low-power processing cores next to memory blocks, the proposed platform implements the entire algorithm directly in memory blocks without using extra processing units. In our platform, each memory block supports the essential operations including: bitwise operation, addition/multiplication, and search operation internally in memory without reading any values out of the block. This significantly mitigates the processing costs of the new architecture, while providing high scalability and parallelism for performing the extensive computations. We exploit these essential operations to accelerate popular big data applications entirely in memory such as machine learning algorithms, query processing, and graph processing. Our evaluations show that for all tested applications, the performance can be accelerated significantly by eliminating the memory access bottleneck},

  abstract         = {As computational resources become more efficient and data sizes grow, data movement is fast becoming the dominant cost in computing. Processing-in-Memory is emerging as a key technique for reducing costly data movement, by enabling computation to be executed on compute resources embedded in the memory modules themselves.  This paper presents the Processing-in-Memory (PIM) model, for the design and analysis of parallel algorithms on systems providing processing-in-memory modules. The PIM model focuses on keys aspects of such systems, while abstracting the rest. Namely, the model combines (i) a CPU-side consisting of parallel cores with fast access to a small shared memory of size M words (as in traditional parallel computing), (ii) a PIM-side consisting of P PIM modules, each with a core and a local memory of size Θ(n/P) words for an input of size n (as in traditional distributed computing), and (iii) a network between the two sides. The model combines standard parallel complexity metrics for both shared memory (work and depth) and distributed memory (local work, communication time) computing. A key algorithmic challenge is to achieve load balance among the PIM modules in both their communication and their local work, while minimizing the communication time. We demonstrate how to overcome this challenge for an ordered search structure, presenting a parallel PIM-skiplist data structure that efficiently supports a wide range of batch-parallel queries and updates.},

Monolithic silicon chips are area and power limited, failing to catch the recent rapid growth of deep learning algorithms. The paper first demonstrates a straightforward layer-wise method that partitions the workload of a monolithic accelerator to a multi-chiplet pipeline. A quantitative analysis shows that the straightforward separation degrades the overall utilization of computing resources due to the reduced on-chiplet memory size, thus introducing a higher memory wall. A tile interleaving strategy is proposed to overcome such degradation. This strategy can segment one layer to different chiplets which maximizes the computing utilization. To facilitate the strategy, the modification of the chiplet system hardware is also discussed. To validate the proposed strategy, a nine-chiplet processing-in-memory system is evaluated with a custom-designed object detection network. Each chiplet can achieve a peak performance of 204.8GOPS at a 100-MHz rate. The peak performance of the overall system is 1.711TOPS, where no off-chip memory access is needed. By the tile interleaving strategy, the utilization is improved from 53.9 to 92.8},

As most of the previously reported 3D memory-based near-memory NN accelerator designs used the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) memory, we first focus on identifying the key differences between HBM and HMC in terms of near-memory NN accelerator design. One of the major differences between the two 3D memories is that HBM has the centralized through-silicon-via (TSV) channels while HMC has distributed TSV channels for separate vaults. Based on the observation, we introduce the Round-Robin Data Fetching and Groupwise Broadcast schemes to exploit the centralized TSV channels for improvement of the data feeding rate for the processing elements. Using synthesized designs in a 28-nm CMOS technology, performance and energy consumption of the proposed architectures with various dataflow models are evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes reduce the runtime by 16.4–39.3\% on average and the energy consumption by 2.1–5.1\% on average compared to conventional data fetching schemes.},

  abstract         = {Neural networks (NNs) have shown great ability to process emerging applications such as speech recognition, language recognition, image classification, video segmentation, and gaming. It is therefore important to make NNs efficient. Although attempts have been made to improve NNs’ computation cost, the data movement between memory and processing cores is the main bottleneck for NNs’ energy consumption and execution time. This makes the implementation of NNs significantly slower on traditional CPU/GPU cores. In this paper, we propose a novel processing in-memory architecture, called NNPIM, that significantly accelerates neural network’s inference phase inside the memory. First, we design a crossbar memory architecture that supports fast addition, multiplication, and search operations inside the memory. Second, we introduce simple optimization techniques which significantly improves NNs’ performance and reduces the overall energy consumption. We also map all NN functionalities using parallel in-memory components. To further improve the efficiency, our design supports weight sharing to reduce the number of computations in memory and consecutively speedup NNPIM computation. We compare the efficiency of our proposed NNPIM with GPU and the state-of-the-art PIM architectures. Our evaluation shows that our design can achieve 131.5 higher energy efficiency and is 48.2 faster as compared to NVIDIA GTX 1,080 GPU architecture. Compared to state-of-the-art neural network accelerators, NNPIM can achieve on an average 3.6 higher energy efficiency and is 4.6 faster, while providing the same classification accuracy.},

  abstract         = {Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an attractive solution to address the “memory wall” challenges for the extensive computation in deep learning hardware accelerators. For custom ASIC design, a specific chip instance is restricted to a specific network during runtime. However, the development cycle of the hardware is normally far behind the emergence of new algorithms. Although some of the reported CIM-based architectures can adapt to different deep neural network (DNN) models, few details about the dataflow or control were disclosed to enable such an assumption. Instruction set architecture (ISA) could support high flexibility, but its complexity would be an obstacle to efficiency. In this article, a runtime reconfigurable design methodology of CIM-based accelerators is proposed to support a class of convolutional neural networks running on one prefabricated chip instance with ASIC-like efficiency. First, several design aspects are investigated: (1) the reconfigurable weight mapping method; (2) the input side of data transmission, mainly about the weight reloading; and (3) the output side of data processing, mainly about the reconfigurable accumulation. Then, a system-level performance benchmark is performed for the inference of different DNN models, such as VGG-8 on a CIFAR-10 dataset and AlexNet GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 on an ImageNet dataset to measure the trade-offs between runtime reconfigurability, chip area, memory utilization, throughput, and energy efficiency.},

  abstract         = {As the speed of processing units grows rapidly, the bottleneck of system’s performance is usually the speed of memory, and the situation is the so-called ”Memory Wall”. There are emerging technologies trying to take down the ”Memory Wall”, and one of them is Processing-in-Memory (PIM). Processing-in-Memory means that the data are processed just inside the memory itself. It does not need to take time to travel between CPU and Memory. Moreover, for very little modifications to memory devices, the memory can do primitive bit-wise operations at the memory side. Binarized Neural Network (BNN), which replaces the convolution’s multiplication and addition operations with bit-wise AND and population count operations, is therefore suited for utilizing PIM to gain performance. This work architects PIM AND, NOT, and population count operations and enables PIM operations working under RISC-V custom instruction encodings. Besides, we also utilize TVM’s support of BNN for application sources. In addition, we offer a new design for BNN’s convolution in which a better memory layout is considered. With our design, the results of the speedup range from 3.7x to 57.3x comparing with CPU-based system for the execution time of end-to-end BNN model inferences.},

  abstract         = {Specialized on-chip accelerators are widely used to improve the energy efficiency of computing systems. Recent advances in memory technology have enabled near-data accelerators (NDAs), which reside off-chip close to main memory and can yield further benefits than on-chip accelerators. However, enforcing coherence with the rest of the system, which is already a major challenge for accelerators, becomes more difficult for NDAs. This is because (1) the cost of communication between NDAs and CPUs is high, and (2) NDA applications generate a lot of off-chip data movement. As a result, as we show in this work, existing coherence mechanisms eliminate most of the benefits of NDAs. We extensively analyze these mechanisms, and observe that (1) the majority of off-chip coherence traffic is unnecessary, and (2) much of the off-chip traffic can be eliminated if a coherence mechanism has insight into the memory accesses performed by the NDA.Based on our observations, we propose CoNDA, a coherence mechanism that lets an NDA optimistically execute an NDA kernel, under the assumption that the NDA has all necessary coherence permissions. This optimistic execution allows CoNDA to gather information on the memory accesses performed by the NDA and by the rest of the system. CoNDA exploits this information to avoid performing unnecessary coherence requests, and thus, significantly reduces data movement for coherence.We evaluate CoNDA using state-of-the-art graph processing and hybrid in-memory database workloads. Averaged across all of our workloads operating on modest data set sizes, CoNDA improves performance by 19.6\% over the highest-performance prior coherence mechanism (66.0\%/51.7\% over a CPU-only/NDA-only system) and reduces memory system energy consumption by 18.0\% over the most energy-efficient prior coherence mechanism (43.7\% over CPU-only). CoNDA comes within 10.4\% and 4.4\% of the performance and energy of an ideal mechanism with no cost for coherence. The benefits of CoNDA increase with large data sets, as CoNDA improves performance over the highest-performance prior coherence mechanism by 38.3\% (8.4x/7.7x over CPU-only/NDA-only), and comes within 10.2\% of an ideal no-cost coherence mechanism.},

  abstract         = {Emerging three-dimensional (3D) memory technologies, such as the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), provide high-bandwidth and massive memory-level parallelism. With the growing heterogeneity and complexity of computer systems (CPU cores and accelerators, etc.), efficiently integrating emerging memories into existing systems poses new challenges and requires detailed evaluation in a realistic computing environment. In this article, we propose MEG, an open source, configurable, cycle-exact, and RISC-V-based full-system emulation infrastructure using FPGA and HBM. MEG provides a highly modular hardware design and includes a bootable Linux image for a realistic software flow, so that users can perform cross-layer software-hardware co-optimization in a full-system environment. To improve the observability and debuggability of the system, MEG also provides a flexible performance monitoring scheme to guide the performance optimization. The proposed MEG infrastructure can potentially benefit broad communities across computer architecture, system software, and application software. Leveraging MEG, we present two cross-layer system optimizations as illustrative cases to demonstrate the usability of MEG. In the first case study, we present a reconfigurable memory controller to improve the address mapping of standard memory controller. This reconfigurable memory controller along with its OS support allows us to optimize the address mapping scheme to fully exploit the massive parallelism provided by the emerging three-dimensional (3D) memories. In the second case study, we present a lightweight IOMMU design to tackle the unique challenges brought by 3D memory in providing virtual memory support for near-memory accelerators. We provide a prototype implementation of MEG on a Xilinx VU37P FPGA and demonstrate its capability, fidelity, and flexibility on real-world benchmark applications. We hope MEG fills a gap in the space of publicly available FPGA-based full-system emulation infrastructures, specifically targeting memory systems, and inspires further collaborative software/hardware innovations.},

  abstract         = {Accurate power modeling is crucial for energy-efficient CPU design and runtime management.
An ideal power modeling framework needs to be accurate yet fast, achieve high temporal
resolution (ideally cycle-accurate) yet with low runtime computational overheads,
and easily extensible to diverse designs through automation. Simultaneously satisfying
such conflicting objectives is challenging and largely unattained despite significant
prior research. In this paper, we propose APOLLO, an automated per-cycle power modeling
framework that serves as the basis for both a design-time power estimator and a low-overhead
runtime on-chip power meter (OPM). APOLLO uses the minimax concave penalty (MCP)-based
feature selection algorithm to automatically select less than 0.05\% of RTL signals
as power proxies. The power estimation achieves R2 &gt; 0.95 on Arm Neoverse N1&nbsp;[3] and
R2 &gt; 0.94 on Arm Cortex-A77&nbsp;[2] microprocessors, respectively. When integrated with
an emulator-assisted flow, APOLLO finishes per-cycle power estimation on millions-of-cycles
benchmark in minutes for million-gate industrial CPU designs. Furthermore, the power
model is synthesized and integrated into the microprocessor implementation as a runtime
OPM. APOLLO’s accuracy further improves when coarse-grained temporal resolution is
preferred. To our best knowledge, this is the first runtime OPM that simultaneously
achieves per-cycle temporal resolution and area/power overhead without compromising
accuracy, which is validated on high-performance, out-of-order industrial CPU designs.},

However, data movements between compute part and memory induce memory wall and power wall challenges to the conventional computing architecture. Recently, the memory-centric architecture has been revised to solve the data movement issue, where the memory is equipped with the compute-capable memory technique, namely, computing-in-memory (CIM). In this paper, we analyze the requirement of AI algorithms on the data movement and low power requirement of AI processors. In addition, we introduce the story of CIM and implementation methodologies of CIM architecture. Furthermore, we present several novel solutions beyond traditional analog-digital mixed static random-access memory (SRAM)-based CIM architecture. Finally, recent CIM tape-out studies are listed and discussed.},

DRAM, however, is primarily designed for density and low cost, with a rigid internal organization that favors coarse-grain streaming rather than byte-level random access. This paper makes the case that treating DRAM as a block-oriented streaming device yields significant efficiency and performance benefits, which motivate for algorithm/architecture co-design to favor streaming access patterns, even at the price of a higher order algorithmic complexity. We present the Mondrian Data Engine that drastically improves the runtime and energy efficiency of basic in-memory analytic operators, despite doing more work as compared to traditional CPU-optimized algorithms, which heavily rely on random accesses and deep cache hierarchies},

An analytic performance model of the GP-SIMD architecture is presented, comparing it to associative processor and to conventional SIMD architectures. Cycle-accurate simulation of four workloads supports the analytical comparison. Assuming a moderate die area, GP-SIMD architecture outperforms both the associative processor and conventional SIMD coprocessor architectures by almost an order of magnitude while consuming less power.},
